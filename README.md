# Groupomania

## About
Groupomania is an internal social media for the workers of a company created with nodejs and reactjs.


## Launch Project
Before everything, you can use npm install in front and back to be sure everything's properly installed. 
Don't forget to create a .env file in the backend folder with SECRET_CONNECTION with your mongoDb access and SECRET_TOKEN for a random token useful with auth events.

Then, you will have to launch two servers: 1 in backend and 1 in frontend

Open a terminal
1. cd backend npm install
2. cd backend nodemon server 

Open an other terminal
1. cd frontend npm install
2. cd frontend npm start
